# Place Details Finder

Microsoft Excel Web Add-in created by Nils Loewen.

Based on the source code generated by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office).

## Problem

"I have a list of stores in my spreadsheet, but I only have partial address information; the store name and the city. I want to fill out my spreadsheet with more information about this store."

## Solution

Use "Place Details Finder" to collect partial address information and query it against Google Places Api. If Google can match Place Details to the search query, the results will be saved to the spreadsheet.

## Features

  - Search by single or multiple rows selected at once.
  - Export found address data as JSON.
